# Start fresh for Tinyfoot implementation

## Context and Problem Statement

For Tinyfoot, we are asked to implement a program with similar functionality as Bigfoot and Littlefoot, and are told that we can either start from a blank repository or fork either Bigfoot or Littlefoot and make extensive changes.

- Would it be better to start from scratch or fork Bigfoot/Littlefoot and change the implementations to better constrain its focus given that we are told Tinyfoot should be more "tight" and "focused" than the complex Bigfoot/Littlefoot implementations?
- What are the implications of each approach on the development process and the final product?

## Considered Options

- Fork Bigfoot and make noticeable changes to code style, architecture, and/or features to tighten the scope of what Bigfoot accomplishes
- Fork Littlefoot and make noticeable changes to code style, architecture, and/or features to tighten the scope of what Littlefoot accomplishes
- Start from scratch with a new implementation of Tinyfoot that implements similar functionality as Bigfoot/Littlefoot but is more focused on the basic footnote integration than Bigfoot/Littlefoot are

## Decision Outcome

We decided to implement Tinyfoot by starting fresh on a blank repository. Given how the assignment instructions emphasized code minimalism, and a tight focus on implementing footnote functionality rather than the complexities that Bigfoot and Littlefoot delve into, we decided it would be a better idea to start Tinyfoot from scratch rather than further bloat Bigfoot or Tinyfoot.
