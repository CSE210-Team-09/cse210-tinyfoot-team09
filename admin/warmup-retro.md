# Challenges

When we began organizing for the Tinyfoot project, the first challenge we faced was work scheduling. Since each team member had different availability times, it was difficult to schedule the time for in-person work meetings and Zoom calls. As a result, we were only able to work as a team during very specific times of the week, and had to rely on Mattermost to communicate with each other, as well as asynchronous work to advance some of our tasks as needed.

While asynchronous work helped us in completing several tasks as individuals, we noticed that we were able to advance much faster with in-person work meetings, where we worked as a team to complete the code and continue our documentation. Unfortunately, due to limited time availability between each member, we had to rely on Zoom for our first few meetings, which was detrimental to our work in the long term. We believe that our earlier meetings should have been in-person work meetings instead of Zoom meetings, in order to get further ahead in the early stages of the Bigfoot/Littlefoot/Tinyfoot project.

Additionally, as we advanced to the later stages of Tinyfoot’s development, it became harder to reach a consensus in the design of the library. As developers, we aimed to improve the code that we had built at that point. While making improvements to the source code is understandable, we only had limited time to work on the library, and it would have been better to discuss design earlier in the week to allow more time for development and documentation.

In terms of how the project should be developed, such as structure of Github repository, what should be included (tests, admin docs, specification), there was a lack of consensus on what should be worked on and how they should be worked on.

| 1    | Leader   | Niyas Attasseri   | I excel at organizing tasks, connecting with the team, and clearly communicating my thought process.                       | I struggled with effectively splitting the team for parts 1 & 2, as I was too focused on balancing group strengths. |
| 2    | Leader   | Jayanth Gorantla  | I was good at encouraging individual team members to give their input towards the project. I also worked a lot on the documentation. | I was very busy this week and couldn’t stay for entire duration of meetings. I also need to learn a lot on the technical side of web programming. |
| 3    | Planner  | Anna Niu          | I was good at organizing and delegating tasks during the project, and provided helpful feedback to other team members. I also contributed to the documentation and overall Github organization/workflow. | I do not have any web development experience and little experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript which limited my contribution during the development phase for Tinyfoot. |
| 4    | Designer | Brandon Olmos     | I am very good at writing documentation and providing ideas for the project’s design. | Very little coding experience in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, which limited my contribution during the development stage of Tinyfoot. |
| 5    | Member   | Krishna Ponnaganti| I am good at writing documentation and also have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. I was involved in the code discussion and completed a few documents. | As I have zero knowledge of JavaScript, I was not able to contribute fully to the design. I was also not good at sharing my opinions as I was hesitant. |
| 6    | Member   | Juhak Lee         | I have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, which allowed me to contribute during the development stage. | I was not very good at documentation, which made it difficult for my teammates to fully understand my work. |
| 7    | Member   | Lucas Lee         | Have previous experiences with software development practices and provided thoughts on how the development of Tinyfoot can be approached | I struggle with honestly communicating my thoughts on level of quality and focus on process that I think should’ve been done. |

# Strengths and Weaknesses of the Team’s Operation

**Strengths**

- As a team, we are very flexible, being able to find common times to meet either in person or virtually.
- We were very efficient in our research and development of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, despite having little to no web development experience.
- Communication was very effective throughout the team. We were able to quickly identify tasks to be completed, address concerns among team members, and delegate work as needed.

**Weaknesses**

- Early on, we relied on Zoom for the first few meetings, which negatively affected our pacing with the Tinyfoot project.
- Asynchronous work, while useful in completing smaller tasks, was detrimental in our ability to complete major parts of the project.
- Operating systems were different among team members, with some using Windows machines while others owned MacOS computers. As a result, the setup process was different for the different tools that we looked into throughout the project, such as the Littlefoot library.

# What Should Be Done Going Forward

As a team, we recognize that we perform much better when we work synchronously. Initially, we made the mistake of only meeting to discuss the warmup exercise on Monday instead of organizing a dedicated work session. If we had held a work session, our progress could have been much faster, and we could have advanced significantly before Friday. However, we did plan a work session for Saturday, which helped accelerate our progress. We also had a productive Zoom meeting on Sunday to finalize tasks for submission, allowing us to wrap up the work on time.

Moving forward, we plan to have a weekly standup and dedicated collaborative work sessions every week throughout the quarter. This approach will enable us to work more effectively on the project.

Moreover, it seems like in person work to first get aligned on tasks needs to be done as there is more effective communication in person.
